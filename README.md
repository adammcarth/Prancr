## Installation

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-prancr
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo prancr
```

## What it makes

It sets you up with a brand new development environment for dashr widgets. Simply run

```bash
npm start
```

And your code will be compiled and run in your browser in a 2x2 container with automatic
watcher scripts recompiling your code and reloading your browser.
